# EMR (.NET 6 MVP)

## Project Overview
This repository contains a basic MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for an Electronic Medical Records (EMR) system built with .NET 6. The application provides essential features for managing patient records, appointments, lab reports, and user roles.

## Database Transition
Originally, this project was designed with a fully relational database using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). Due to errors and the loss of the original database, the system was reconfigured to use SQLite to restore working functionality. This change allowed the project to remain operational, but there may be some inconsistencies or errors in the current database implementation. These will be addressed and improved in future updates.

## Current Status
- Basic MVP features are implemented, including:
  - Patient registration and management
  - Appointment scheduling
  - Lab report uploads and management
  - Doctor and user information
- Data storage is currently handled via SQLite.
- Some features may be incomplete or contain bugs due to the database migration.

## Future Development
- Refactor the database and codebase to follow industry standards and best practices.
- Advance core features and add new functionalities.
- Improve code quality, architecture, and documentation.
- Restore and enhance relational integrity and advanced features as originally planned with SSMS.
